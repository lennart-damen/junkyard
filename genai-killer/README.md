# genai-killer

Idea is roughly as follows (focused on linkedin, but perhaps translates to other social media)

- Create social profile
- Start following other profiles
- Scrape posts of those profiles
- Score each post with likelihood that it's generated by AI
    - Use AI to do the scoring, just an LLM call
    - Design for multiple LLM calls
- Score the profile (is this AI or not?) based on the posts
- If there is a profile with very high score, mark it
    - Optionally, report it on the social platform
- Repeat by following and ranking the connections of the high score profile

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/genai-killer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
